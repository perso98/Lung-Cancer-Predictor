# Lung Cancer Prediction Project

This project is a web application for predicting the probability of having lung cancer based on various input features. It uses a machine learning model trained with TensorFlow and Keras, and is implemented with Flask for the web interface.

## Project Contents

- **Flask Application**: 
  - `main.py`: The main script that runs the Flask web application.
  - `templates/index.html`: The HTML template for the web form.

- **Model Training**:
  - `model.ipynb`: A script to preprocess data, train the model, and save the trained model and scaler.
  - `predict_lung_cancer_model.keras`: The saved trained model.
  - `scaler.pkl`: The saved scaler for normalizing input data.
